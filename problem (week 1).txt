problem:
    - login and register are succeed but can't get/post data to dashboard
      the problem is cross-origin policy from mozilla and im not using class based
      but function based (export default), but when i discussed with
      my friend, he suggest that using react component like class clock extend React.component will do
    
    - now the problem is "Constructor URLSearchParams requires 'new'"
      but in my code i had created new on URLSearchParams. then error on all

    - to solve the problem above, we need variable form from getElementByID post-form
      and fix some syntax using based react component

    - had some bugs, the register cannot post data/response.!ok

feature:
    - list register user
    - login succed but dont know how to control response.ok
    - frontend login,register
